# 🛒 Amazon Homepage Clone using HTML & CSS

This project is a **clone of Amazon's front page**, built entirely using **HTML and CSS**.

## ✅ Features:

- ✅ Fully structured layout similar to Amazon's homepage  
- ✅ **Custom hover effects and transitions (ease-in, ease-out) added on boxes** for visual appeal  
  - *(Note: These effects are not present on the original Amazon site — added by me to enhance UI)*  
- ✅ All major navigation links redirect to the original Amazon pages  
- ✅ Login and Signup buttons also take users to Amazon’s real auth pages  
- ✅ Footer links are clickable and redirect properly  
- ✅ Clean and organized HTML/CSS code

## 🎯 Purpose:

This project was built for practice and to demonstrate my front-end skills.  
I focused on replicating real-world structure, and also **added interactive animations and hyperlink redirections** to make the clone look functional and user-friendly.
